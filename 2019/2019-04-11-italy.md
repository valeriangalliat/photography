April 2019

Drove from Grenoble to Torino on the 11th of April. The drive through
the Alps on the D1091, by Oulles, Bourg-d'Oisans, Mont-de-Lans and La
Grave, all the way to Briancon was incredibly gorgeous, but
unfortunately we didn't have the time to stop for pictures, so I have no
trace of that. I just wrote this paragraph to remember to go back and do
that again (ideally on a bicycle or motorcycle).

## April 14, Lerici

We woke up in Lerici, and while the weather wasn't the best, the village
was still gorgeous. It felt a lot like Cassis, but in Italy.

## April 14 & 15 Pisa

While we were headed to Montepulciano early in the morning, we blew a
tire. It was a Sunday, but luckily we were just next to Pisa (which we
didn't plan to visit in the first place). So we stopped there to wait
for the next day to find an open garage, and visited the city meanwhile.

incredibly short amount of time.

## April 15, Montepulciano

We visited the city of Montepulciano, Tuscany during the day, and did a
visit and wine tasting at the [Canneto winery](https://www.cannetowinetasting.com/),
which produces amazing natural wine.

## April 16, Firenze

We arrived on the 15th at night near Firenze. We managed to plant the
tent in a random olive tree field, which was a pretty nice and cozy spot
to sleep in, especially with the low profile MSR Hubba Hubba NX military
grade cover.

We then went to visit the city.
