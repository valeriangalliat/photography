# ü¶Ä Gasp√©sie
June 2019

In June, I went on a road trip with my mom and a couple of her friends
around Gasp√©sie. We took the 132 road all the way around, starting by
the North side.

I was riding my motorcycle, while they were in a car. For the story,
I've had many issues with my motorcycle before this trip, especially a
battery charging issue that I was struggling with since the beginning of
the season, that turned out to be a toast stator and regulator that I
got replaced just before the trip. The motorcycle ended up running
mostly fine for all that trip, even though a couple of times it died and
wouldn't start anymore unless I push start it, turned out it would start
again after a little wait, and while I could never explain those, the
new stator and regulator were doing a good job for sure.

I ran out of gas only once, where I was glad my mom and her friends were
close by in a car with the gas jerrycan I had to get the last time I ran
out of gas.

However the speedometer died about halfway through the trip, which meant
the odometer died too, so I lost track of the travelled kilometers at
that point. Overall, I think the whole trip was about 2200 km.

## June 22, Mont Albert

Decided to hike the Mont Albert, which was I think the highest peak
around. It "just opened" the day before, and there turned out to be
plenty of snow on top still.

There was a rope setup to climb the last part which was a nearly
vertical snow wall, which was kinda sketchy as one of the poles holding
the rope in the middle broke down so the rope was only attached to the
top pole and was swinging around a lot.

A number of people seemed to give up at that point, which is why the
summit was absolutely empty except for another climber that I saw from
far away. It was also *extremely* windy.

The landscape at the top was the last thing I expected. It was basically
an immense flat altitude desert.

It was absolutely empty other than a couple of mountain goats far away.

## June 26, Carleton

The weather was trash when we arrived in Carleton, including the ride
there, so I was pretty much soaking wet from riding for hours in the
rain. It was still early in the afternoon, so I decided to go on a hike
still. I rode my motorcycle in the rain on a long hilly and slippery
dirty path to get to the start of the hike, where I prayed for the rain
to not make the dirt soft enough for my bike to fall.

The hike turned out much longer than I expected, and I ended up coming
back in the beginning of the night, riding in the dark still in the rain
on that wet path to get back to the hotel.

Needless to say the weather was so bad that even though I went by a
number of what were supposed to be point of view, there was literally
nothing to see as the fog didn't let me see more than a couple meters
ahead of me.

I still took a beer with me and attempted a couple of my classic beer
shots at the summit.
