# üèû Mont Pinacle
October 2021

A bit of a crowded hike, but it's short and the panorama at the top is
sure worth it!

Brought a "Ta Moins Forte" by Lagabi√®re at the top of the hike! I love
how the colors of the can match those of the fall landscape behind it.

The spot pictured here is the one where everybody goes to take photos,
it seems. I went there too for the last picture of this album.

Mont Pinacle also features a big climbing wall with lots of known trad
routes (and a handful of sport too). Might go there with a rope some
day!

Finally, the "cool" spot where the view is fully clear.
