# ðŸ¥® Magdelen Islands
July 2021

We've been a bit all over the place in a pretty random order, so for
once, I'll arrange the pics by place instead of by chronological order.

## Plage de la Dune de l'Ouest

## Cap de l'Anse Ã  Johnny

Started from *chemin de l'Ã‰tang des Caps* and walked around the cliffs,
where we got pretty nice views.

## ÃŽle Bourdeau

*L'Ã®le Boudreau* is a very thin rock formation between *plage du Bassin
Ouest* and *plage du Bassin Est* (I like how names are straightforward
in Magdelen Islands).

different view on the lighthouse and the *Plaque-Verte* area as well as
the surroundings.
