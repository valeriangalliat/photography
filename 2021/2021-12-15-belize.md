In the next pictures, if you look closely, you can see my girlfriend
standing next to that huge tree. They're called the tree of life,
and in Mayan culture, they're sacred tree that allow the souls of humans
to travel into the underworld or the heavens.

I didn't use my camera a whole lot during this trip, and I don't really
publish phone pictures on this website, but hey, it's better than
nothing!
