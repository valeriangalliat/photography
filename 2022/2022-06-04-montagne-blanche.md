# üèï Montagne Blanche
June 2022

Because of a tornado in the area a week before, the hiking trail was
covered with fallen trees everywhere. Pretty crazy.

And finally the way back, still with fallen trees everywhere. The hike
was a challenge, especially with our big packs.

We made it to a nice lake, just next to a refuge (Refuge de l'Appel).
