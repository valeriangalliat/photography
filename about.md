Hey there! I'm [Val](https://val.codejam.info/), and you'll find on this
website most of the pictures that I took since I got my camera in 2017.

I shoot with a Panasonic LX100 because it's lightweight and compact
while still having manual controls for most settings that I care about.
It also shoots 4K video which, while irrelevant for this website, is
very useful for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/FunkyVal).

This allows me to take it with me pretty much everywhere I go without it
being a big commitment, and I can carry it strapped around my chest
while I hike or walk around without it bothering me, while being able to
draw it in a matter of seconds if I need to.

Even though I don't get the quality and versatility that a solid DSLR
with a couple of lenses would deliver (particularly zoom length and
depth of field), it's still pretty fucking good if you ask me, and the
fact it enables me to have a proper camera in my hands in situations
where I would likely not have bothered to bring with me a full DSLR
setup is definitely worth the tradeoff.
