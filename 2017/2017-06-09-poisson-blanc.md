# üê† Poisson Blanc
June 2017

In early June 2017, we went to the [Lac du Poisson-Blanc](http://poissonblanc.ca/en/),
where you can rent an island on the lake and go camp there, getting to
it with canoes, kayaks, paddleboards and so on.

We went to the [Paroi √âl√©phant](http://poissonblanc.ca/en/site/63b-la-paroi-elephant/)
spot which have the advantage of being right next to a crag right above
the lake.

It took us a couple hours to get there, as the spot is 15 km away from
the base camp. We arrived right before the sunset, and just had the time
to plant the tents and light a fire before the sun went down.

The next morning, we visited more deeply the island. There was a path to
hike to the top of the cliff, with a gorgeous view on the lake.

Later in the day, we prepared to scale the Paroi √âl√©phant. It features
[3 sport routes](https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/canada/quebec/area/973857777)
(which we're equipped for). We went for the 5.8 one in the middle which
is also the longest. We hiked again to the top, set up an anchor and
threw the rope down for our friends to grab it from a canoe.

We could then belay each other on the top rope, from the canoe.
